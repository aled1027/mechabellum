# Agent Notes

This repo’s roadmap lives in `IMPLEMENATATION_PLAN.md` (intentional filename) and the design reference is `GDD.md`.
Use those two documents as the source of truth for implementation details and requirements.

Quality bar: keep code quality high. Run the linter and formatter regularly, and add extensive tests. Testing should happen after most changes, and any new changes must be tested.
