Refined requirements:
- Use Vite for dev server/build.
- Rendering tech: WASM + WebGL/WebGPU (set up pipeline; can stub assets initially).
- Scaffold minimal HTML/CSS shell.
- Entrypoint should run full local match simulation (not mocked HUD-only).
- Stub asset loading (sprites/fonts) is acceptable for now.

Deliverables:
- Browser entrypoint (e.g., src/client/app.ts + index.html) wiring sim loop, renderer, and UI.
- Vite config and npm scripts (dev/build/preview) to run locally.
- Basic asset stubs and load path conventions.
