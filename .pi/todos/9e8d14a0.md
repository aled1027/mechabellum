Implement title screen/match flow, interactive planning UI (shop/tech/cards/specialists + placement validation), combat presentation (health bars/VFX/audio), and expose replay controls. Wire localization/accessibility toggles and asset loading into renderer. Milestone: player can complete planning/combat loops and replay end-to-end.
