Added deterministic input ordering and sync checksum reporting.

- Introduced deterministic placement ordering in `MatchRoom` and included a combat `checksum` computed via `computeSyncChecksum`.
- Added `computeSyncChecksum` helper in `src/sim/qa.ts`.
- Added tests in `tests/server/matchRoom.test.ts` for ordering and checksum presence, plus sync checksum stability in `tests/sim/qaSnapshots.test.ts`.

Tests: `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`.
