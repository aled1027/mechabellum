Implemented placement UI interactions with selection, rotation, preview, and validation feedback.

- Added `src/client/placementInteraction.ts` to manage placement interaction state, hover previews, rotation, and confirmation using validation feedback.
- Exported placement interaction APIs via `src/index.ts`.
- Added `tests/client/placementInteraction.test.ts` covering valid placement requests, error feedback, and rotation updates.

Tests: `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`.
