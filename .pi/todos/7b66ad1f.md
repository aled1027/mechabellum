Added unit inspection/tooltip data builder with stats, techs, and status effects.

- Added `src/client/unitInspection.ts` to build inspection states from definitions or live sim units.
- Exported inspection APIs via `src/index.ts`.
- Added `tests/client/unitInspection.test.ts` covering static and sim-derived inspection data.

Tests: `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`.
