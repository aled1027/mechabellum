Added replay determinism checksum capture and validation.

- Added checksum field to replay rounds and zod schema in `src/sim/replay.ts`.
- Exported `computeReplayChecksum` and added `validateReplayPayload` in `src/sim/replayValidator.ts` for mismatch reporting.
- Recorded checksums during match resolution in `MatchRoom` and added tests to validate payload mismatch reporting.

Tests: `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`.
