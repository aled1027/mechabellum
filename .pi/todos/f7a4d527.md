Defined combat HUD layout and information hierarchy with a new combat HUD state builder.

- Added `src/client/combatHud.ts` with layout metadata (primary/secondary/tertiary regions) and combat HUD state summary for friendly/enemy durability/value.
- Exported combat HUD APIs from `src/index.ts`.
- Added `tests/client/combatHud.test.ts` covering summaries and layout usage.

Tests: `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`.
