Implemented periodic snapshot capture and desync recovery data.

- Added `SnapshotBuffer` with checksum generation in `src/sim/snapshots.ts` and `computeStateChecksum` in `src/sim/qa.ts`.
- Extended `ServerAuthoritativeSim` to record snapshots at configurable intervals and expose them.
- Plumbed snapshot config into `MatchRoom`, added snapshots to combat snapshots, and exported snapshots via `src/index.ts`.
- Added tests in `tests/sim/snapshots.test.ts` and updated `tests/server/matchRoom.test.ts`.

Tests: `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`.
