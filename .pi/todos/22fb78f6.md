Defined replay serialization format and persistence hooks.

- Added zod validation for replay payloads in `src/sim/replay.ts` along with `serializeReplayPayload`/`parseReplayPayload` helpers.
- Added `ReplayStorage` interface and `InMemoryReplayStorage` implementation for persistence hooks.
- Added `tests/sim/replayFormat.test.ts` to verify serialization and storage behavior.

Tests: `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`.
