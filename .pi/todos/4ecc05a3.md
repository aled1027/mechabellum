Added multiplayer load testing/soak tooling.

- Added `src/tools/loadTest.ts` to simulate multiple matches/rounds with deterministic placements.
- Added `tests/tools/loadTest.test.ts` to validate load test output.
- Added `load:test` script to `package.json`.

Tests: `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`.
