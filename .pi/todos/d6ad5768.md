Implemented reconnect/resync flow with revision tracking.

- Added `revision` to `MatchSnapshot` and incremented it on round start/combat resolution.
- Added `ResyncSnapshot` and `MatchRoom.resync` to return a reasoned resync payload.
- Added tests for resync snapshots and revision tracking in `tests/server/matchRoom.test.ts`.

Tests: `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`.
