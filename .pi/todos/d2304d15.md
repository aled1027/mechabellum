Implemented replay playback UI control state and helpers.

- Added `src/client/replayControls.ts` with playback state, speed validation, round switching, tick scrubbing, and timeline sync.
- Exported replay control APIs via `src/index.ts`.
- Added `tests/client/replayControls.test.ts` covering play toggles, scrubbing, speed updates, and timeline sync.

Tests: `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`.
