Added replay capture persistence hooks in match flow.

- Extended `MatchRoomConfig` to accept `replayId` and `replayStorage` options.
- Persisted replay payloads via `ReplayStorage` after each combat resolution in `MatchRoom`.
- Added test coverage in `tests/server/matchRoom.test.ts` using `InMemoryReplayStorage`.

Tests: `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`.
