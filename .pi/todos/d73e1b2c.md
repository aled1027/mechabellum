Added combat HUD overlay data for unit health bars and status indicators.

- Added `src/client/combatOverlay.ts` to build per-unit overlay state with HP/shield percentages, status effect list, and low-health flag.
- Exported combat overlay API via `src/index.ts`.
- Added `tests/client/combatOverlay.test.ts` validating overlay calculations and status effects.

Tests: `npm run format`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`.
